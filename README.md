This is a sample application developed with Ruby on Rails, based on the tutorial from
the book Agile Web Development with Rails, Fourth Edition. 

Specifically, this is an eCommerce app with products that visitors can click to add
to their shopping cart, as well as remove by clicking Empty Cart. 

Additionally, if users would like to continue with their purchase, they may checkout and
enter their personal details, after which their order will be processed.

This app also allows administrators to log in, check on the orders that have been processed,
create a new order, add or remove products in the store, as well as view/edit/delete users.
